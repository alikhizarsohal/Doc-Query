# DocQuery - Intelligent Document Search with OpenAI APIs

## Overview
DocQuery is a document search application developed using OpenAIâ€™s GPT APIs. This project was completed between January 2024 and February 2024. The application integrates backend services implemented in Node.js for parsing, indexing, and interaction with OpenAI's API. Additionally, a user-friendly frontend interface was built using React.js, allowing users to upload documents and query them for relevant information. 

## Features
- **Document Parsing and Indexing**: The backend services in Node.js handle the parsing and indexing of documents, enabling efficient search functionality.
- **Integration with OpenAI's GPT APIs**: The application interacts with OpenAI's GPT APIs to provide advanced search capabilities.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The React.js frontend offers an intuitive interface for users to upload documents and query them.
- **Options for Document Management**: Users can either upload their own documents or query pre-existing documents stored on the server.
